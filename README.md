# SVM_Iris_Dataset

The Iris dataset is a famous dataset mostly used for classification exercises.
The dataset consists of different physical parameters about the dimension of 3 different species of a plant.
Based on these parameters I tried to identify/classify the species of the test sample.
Here I used a Support-Vector-Machine model.
